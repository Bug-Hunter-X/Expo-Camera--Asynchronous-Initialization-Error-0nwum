# Expo Camera Asynchronous Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has finished initializing.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**
The original code tries to access camera functions immediately within the `useEffect` hook, leading to errors because the camera isn't ready yet.  The solution involves using asynchronous operations and states to manage the camera's initialization status.

**Solution:**
The solution uses the `useState` hook to track camera initialization.  Once the camera is ready (`cameraRef.current`), operations are executed.
